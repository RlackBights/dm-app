# Project Æris 

### Welcome to **Project Æris**!
A neat, steampunk-themed web app for easy campaign management!

I'm sure you - as everyone here - **love** digging through your tens, if not *hundreds* (may god have mercy upon your soul) of text files in a folder structure not yet mapped out by cartographers!

We all do that, right? ***Right?***

Well no matter, this wonderful tool will try to provide a remedy to this neverending cycle of looking for notes!

## Features

### None :D
- For now, just started development, gimme time to cook something up

---

## Keybinds

I want to make the usage of this app as smooth as possible, so I figured I'll add some keybinds to make the life of everyone easier. I'll update this table as I develop new features!
| Keybind | Feature                   |
|---------|---------------------------|
| `Tab`   | Opens the navigation menu |

## Roadmap

I'm planning on adding lots of neat stuff to the project, and you can find the current progress and all of my ideas/plans on my Trello board [here](https://trello.com/b/KJmSj30K/dm-app)!

 I'll try to keep the following list updated as well, with the most important features and the ones I'm currently working on!

### WIP
- **Encounter Creator:** Lets the DM generate encounters on the fly with lots of customizazion options!

### Essential features
- **Session Summary:** Gathers information from the last session and compiles them into a short description the DM can skim over in a matter of minutes to help them get back on track quickly!
- **Story Progression Tracker:** A checklist that contains every important lore-point planned for the whole campaign, which the DM can edit at any time!
- **Turn Order Tracker:** Quite self-explanatory, just tracks information like initiative related to the current combat. I'm planning on making this feature into a while Combat Tracker later on, with stats and status effects!
- **Campaign Timeline:** Gives the DM a timeline to plot different events on. I'd imagine it being useful for recording every historically significant event that happened before the players arrived, so the DM can be consistent with reffering back to said events. Maybe plans for branching timelines in the future?

## Installation

### Prerequisites
(Presumably, you have both since you're here somehow)
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Internet connection

### Steps
**Whole project:**
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run `npm i` to download the required modules
3. Run `npm run start` to start a local server, and enjoy!
4. Optional: You can build the project yourself using `npm run build`
(Note that you will probably need to modify the `homepage` value in the package.json file when hosting it somewhere)

## Usage

### Navigation
- Use the collapsible sidebar to access the main features.
- Keyboard shortcut support!!!

### Creating and Managing Content
- Select a feature (e.g., Encounter Creator) from the sidebar.
- Use the intuitive interface to input data and save your work.
- Link related elements (e.g., NPCs to encounters, notes to maps) for seamless management.
- **I will write short descriptions for every feature that's done, so you can refer back here if anything's unclear**

## Contribution

### How to Contribute
I'm not taking actual contributions as of now, first I want to implement everything I planned for the app myself. After I'm done contributions will be welcome though!

### Bug Reports
Open an issue here on GitHub (no idea how to do that yet, but I believe in you!) and I'll take a look at it! Try tagging it with the severity if you can, so I can focus on the more important ones first!
